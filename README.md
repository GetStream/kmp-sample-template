# KMP Sample Template

This is a simple Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform template designed to build applications for both Android and iOS.

## Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)

[Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) is designed with a focus on flexibility and adaptability, bridging the gap between cross-platform and native development. It allows developers to share business logic across platforms while retaining full access to native APIs for platform-specific implementations. This enables a unique balance: developers can reuse common code across Android, iOS, Web, and other platforms, while also integrating native functionalities where needed. With KMP, you get cross-platform efficiency combined with the performance and features of native development, offering the best of both worlds.

## Compose Multiplatform

[Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform), built on top of Kotlin Multiplatform, allows developers to share UI logic across various platforms using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose). It functions similarly to Jetpack Compose on Android, extending the same declarative UI approach to multiple environments. Built on the existing Compose compiler and runtime system, Compose Multiplatform enables the creation of UIs for Android, iOS, desktop, and webâ€”all using a consistent, Kotlin-based syntax. This approach helps unify UI development, allowing for code reuse and efficiency across different platforms while maintaining a native look and feel.
